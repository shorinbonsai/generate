A straight forward Genetic Algorithm to look for lower bounds for either hamming distance or edit distance codewords.

It evolves a list of seed codewords for a particular set of parameters and a Greedy Lexicode algorithm fills out the remainder.

Individuals are indirectly indexed with respect to remaining candidate codewords.
